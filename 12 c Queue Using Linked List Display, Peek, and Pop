# 12 d Queue Using Linked List â€“ Enqueue and All Operations

## Aim

To write a Python program to add 4 elements to a queue and print the elements present at the front and rear of the queue.

## Algorithm

1. Start
2. Create an empty queue using deque
3. Insert 4 elements using append()
4. Print the front element using queue[0]
5. Print the rear element using queue[-1]
6. Stop

## Program

```python

queue = []

queue.append('a')
queue.append('b')
queue.append('c')
queue.append('d')

print('Initial Queue: ' + str(queue))

print(f"\nElement at the front of the queue is ....  {queue[0]}")


print(f"\nElement at the rear of the queue is ....  {queue[3]}")
```
